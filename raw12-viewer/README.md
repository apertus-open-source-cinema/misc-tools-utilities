Output is not meant to replace a proper raw development workflow but is meant as a quick and easy way to see what a raw12 file contains.

# Prerequsiites
```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-tk python3-opencv
pip3 install PySimpleGUI
```

# Usage

run with:

```python3 raw12viewer.py image.raw12```
